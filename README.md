I’m continuing work on my CinnaCoal project – a business producing cinnamon-infused bamboo charcoal briquettes. So far, we’ve developed:

- A full business plan in Jamaican dollars (JMD)

- Financial documents: Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow

- Detailed composition of a standardized 120g briquette

- Breakdown of cost, sales price, and profit for 2 lb, 10 lb, and 20 lb packs

- Downloadable PDF summaries

Let’s now continue with an Agenda for a meeting with potential investors
